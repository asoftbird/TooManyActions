# TooManyActions

Blender addon (3.3.0+) that adds a shortcut for easily changing the colors of nodes.
Select one or multiple nodes, hit CTRL+Q and select a color. 
Colors can also be removed easily through this menu.

Don't like the default colors? The palette is registered in config.py and can be edited. You may need to restart blender for the changes to take effect.

This is just a start for an addon which I want to give more functionality, so it's just colors for now.
